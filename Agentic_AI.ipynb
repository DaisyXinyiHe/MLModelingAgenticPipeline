To improve the model, consider the following: 1) Feature selection or engineering to identify more relevant features. 2) Hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting 'max_depth', 'learning_rate', or 'n_estimators'. 3) Trying different model types, such as Random Forest or Neural Networks, to see if they capture the patterns better. 4) Increasing the size of the training data if possible, or using techniques like data augmentation. 5) Implementing regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.\"\n",
